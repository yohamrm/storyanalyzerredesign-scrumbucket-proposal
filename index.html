On the front end side of the work, we will provide user research, personas, wireframes, visual mockups, bootstrap prototypes, and a newly designed dashboard for the product. On the back end, we will use various techniques to integrate our web application with the Story analyzer. We will also fully integrate database capabilities to our application while also handling threats such as sql injection and cross site scripting.
